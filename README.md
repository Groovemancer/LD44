# Blood Collector
A clicker game made for Ludum Dare #44 game jam. Theme: Your Life is Currency


Blood Collector is a clicker game with survival in mind.
You're a vampire, click enemies to fight them. Mouse over the blood to collect, but don't wait too long, it'll disappear.
Spend blood to upgrade yourself. Be careful though, if you run out of blood it's "Game Over"
